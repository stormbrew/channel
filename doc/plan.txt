Stage 1: Ruby parser, execution simply proxying to ruby calls
- write basic parser to translate documents into token trees
 - parse simple 'documents'
  x implement tuplesets
   - add squarebracket tuplesets (unary tuples?)
  x implement tuples
  x implement strings
  - implement barewords 
   - split barewords into symbolic (non-alnumunder) and alnumunder
   - make alnumunder barewords transform into labels with : at end
  - implement 'labels'
 x unit test parser with rspecs
- write engine that runs commands from parse tree through ruby
 - make it able to run sample.ch (which is entirely procedural)
 - make it able to run object_sample.ch (which is object oriented)
Stage 2: C parser (probably not using parser generator), execution still passing through to ruby interpreter
Stage 3: C parser, custom execution engine
Stage 4: ...
Stage 5: Profit.
